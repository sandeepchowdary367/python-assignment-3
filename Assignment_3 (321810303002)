Take two inputs from user and check whether they are equal or not.
In [2]:
a=int(input("enter a value"))
b=int(input("enter b value"))
if a==b:
    print("equal")
else:
    print("notequal")
enter a value3
enter b value2
notequal
Take 3 inputs from user and check :
 all are equal
 any of two are equal
 ( use and or )
In [9]:
a=int(input("enter a value"))
b=int(input("enter b value"))
c=int(input("enter c value"))
all = a == b and b == c and c == a
print ("All are equal:",all)
any = a == b or b == c or c== a
print ("Any of three are equal:",any)
enter a value5
enter b value4
enter c value5
All are equal: False
Any of three are equal: True
Take two number and check whether the sum is greater than 5, less than 5 or equal to 5.
In [10]:
a=int(input("enter a value"))
b=int(input("enter b value"))
sum=a+b
print("sum is greater than 5 ",sum>5)
print("sum is lesser than 5",sum<5)
print("sum is equal to 5",sum==5)
enter a value3
enter b value4
sum is greater than 5  True
sum is lesser than 5 False
sum is equal to 5 False
Suppose passing marks of a subject is 35. Take input of marks from user and check whether it is greater than passing marks or not.
In [13]:
passingmarks=35
studentmarks=int(input("enter student marks"))
print("if marks is greater than passing marks",studentmarks>passingmarks)
enter student marks85
if marks is greater than passing marks True
Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers
In [15]:
a=int(input("enter a:"))
b=int(input("enter b:"))
c=int(input("enter c:"))
if (a>=b) and (a>=c):
    print("a is max of three numbers")
elif (b>=a) and (b>=c):
    print("b is max of three numbers")
else:
    print("c is max of three numbers")
enter a:4
enter b:6
enter c:7
c is max of three numbers
